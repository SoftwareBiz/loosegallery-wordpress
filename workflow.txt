API Documentation: Link
Purpose:
To create a WooCommerce-compatible WordPress plugin for LooseGallery that integrates the LooseGallery design editor with existing store products, allowing users to customize products, save their designs, and finalize purchases within WooCommerce.

1. Plugin Objectives:
•	Seamlessly integrate LooseGallery Editor with WooCommerce products.
•	Allow users to customize select products and return to complete their order.
•	Provide admin controls to configure API and design settings.
•	Display customized designs in product pages and cart.
•	Ensure that final designs are locked after order completion.

2. Admin Backend Options (Plugin Settings Page):
•	API Key for authenticating with multiple LooseGallery accounts (DOM) at the same time & display the domain name (Secure field for authenticating with LooseGallery)
•	LooseGallery to Website Redirect URL (Return URL after editing)
•	Website to LooseGallery Redirect URL (URL to redirect user to editor)
•	Customizable Products
o	Add a checkbox in each product's settings:
	Customizable Product
	Select LooseGallery DOM to link to (Domain Name)
	Template Serial Number field
•	Start Design Button Text Field & Color/Font Options
•	Customize Me Tag Text Field & Color/Font Options
•	Copyright Text Field



3. Frontend Functionality:
3.1 Product Page Display:
•	Show a "Customize Me" tag on products marked as customizable. The SVG of the tag design is attached.
 
•	Display a button that links the user to the LooseGallery Editor with the relevant serial number & relevant domain. (Start Design Button)
 
•	Only show the tag/button if the product is marked customizable and linked to a valid serial number.
3.2 Return from Editor:
•	User returns to the WooCommerce product page.
 
•	The plugin should capture the design's serial number and display a preview image (low-res) from the LooseGallery API.
•	This image should replace the default product image.
•	The selected design is saved and tied to the user's session/account.

4. Cart and Checkout Behavior:
4.1 Cart Display (Cart Page & Sidebar):
•	Show a thumbnail of the user-designed product (low-res preview).
•	Display an "Edit Your Design" button to allow design modifications.
•	If user attempts to delete the product:
o	Show alert:
"Warning: Your design will be inaccessible if removed from the cart."


4.2 Checkout Restrictions:
•	Add a checkbox labeled:
"I agree to the copyright ownership and understand my design will be printed as is."
•	Checkout cannot proceed unless this checkbox is ticked.

5. Order Placement & Finalization:
•	On successful order placement:
o	Lock the design from further editing via API.
o	Disable the "Edit Your Design" button for this order. (Hide)
o	Store the design serial number in order meta.

6. API Integration Points:
•	Start Design: Generate editor link using template serial number.
•	Return from Editor: Handle return redirect and store serial.
•	Get Image Preview: Show low-res image preview.
•	Lock Design (Post-Order): Disable further editing.
(Refer to: https://editor.loosegallery.com/api-documentation/ for exact endpoints.)

7. Notes:
•	Plugin should store the user's design state in case of logout/session expiration.
•	The design should persist with WooCommerce user account.
•	Ensure mobile responsiveness of all plugin elements.
•	Consider shortcodes or hooks for theme compatibility.
•	The plugin should not be tied to just one theme & should be able to work with all themes.





Final Deliverables:
•	Fully functional WordPress plugin with WooCommerce support
•	Admin panel for configuration
•	Frontend integration for product pages and cart
•	API integration with LooseGallery
•	Final design handling post-purchase
•	Clear inline code comments and documentation
